### Ebay Price Tracker
---
A simple webscraping application used to log prices of Ebay listings.
This is currently unfinished, but has working price logging and graphing functionality, as well as persistence.
Webscraping is done with the BeautifulSoup library.
Data analysis and manipulation is done with Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.
